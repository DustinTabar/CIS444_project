    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p1>
        To understand what makes The Bruery truly special, you first have to understand how we started: just Patrick Rue in his
        kitchen with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for how interesting beer can be. It was his passion and insatiable
        curiosity that led him to open a brewery, build a team of world-class like-minded brewers and eventually earn the title
        of Master Cicerone. This unique combination of unwavering creativity, unquestionable expertise, and relentless
        innovation, drive us to craft beers that quite frankly, might change the way you think about beer.
